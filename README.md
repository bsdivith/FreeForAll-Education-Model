Free Education Model for India
Designing a world-class free education system inspired by the best global models.

📌 About the Project
This project aims to create a high-quality, free education model for India, combining the best aspects of global education systems. The goal is to influence policymakers and create a grassroots movement for accessible, real-world, and culturally rich education.
